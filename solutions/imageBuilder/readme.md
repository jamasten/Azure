# Azure Image Builder

This solution will deploy all the Azure resources needed to build an image with Azure Image Builder (AIB). It includes all of Microsoft's security best practices. Each time a new build is run, the AIB service will use a pre-configured virtual network with private link to connect to the virtual machine. This avoids the use of public IP addresses. The role assignments given to the AIB service and Automation Account are the minimum required, adhering to least privilege.

The Image Template is currently configured to run the [Virtual Desktop Optimization Tool](https://github.com/The-Virtual-Desktop-Team/Virtual-Desktop-Optimization-Tool), install Microsoft Project & Visio, and update the operating system. The customization steps in the Image Template can be modified to fulfill your solution requirements. Refer to the [Microsoft Learn page](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/image-builder-json?tabs=json%2Cazure-powershell#properties-customize) for details on the allowed customizations.

## Build Automation

A feature of this solution is build automation. This feature uses an Automation Runbook and a Logic App to check if a new Azure Marketplace image version has been released since you're last Image Template build. If the Marketplace image version is newer, a new build will be initiated on the Image Template.

If a resource ID for a Log Analytics Workspace is specified during deployment, the Automation Runbook's job logs and streams will be captured in the workspace. This will allow you to create alerts around the Image Template builds so you will know when a new Image Version has been added to your Compute Gallery or when a build fails.

## Prerequisites

- Virtual Network (Required): ensure a virtual network has been deployed and the target subnet has an assigned Network Security Group with the required rule configured: [PowerShell for NSG Rule](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/image-builder-vnet#add-an-nsg-rule)

## Deployment Options
